# Creating and Using a Class

This work is adapted from "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the best approaches to code software. In OOP, we will write classes that will represent real-world things and situations. Then we will write objects based on these classes. When writing classes, we will define the behavior that objects can have/do.

The process of making an object from classes is called instantiation, and we will work with the instances of a class. In this part, we will learn how to write classes and create instances from those classes.
